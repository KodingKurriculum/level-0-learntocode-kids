# Level 0: Learn to Code Kids
A fun and interactive lesson for kids to learn the basics of coding.

## Technology is Everywhere
How many of you have played a video game, used Facebook, or have a cell phone?  If you look around, it isn't hard to find technology everywhere. Technology can help us do important things, no matter what you want to be when you grow up!

Doctors, police officers, teachers, and even athletes depend on technology to do their job better.

## What does it mean to code?
When you write code, you are telling the computer what to do.  The code you write is called software. Technology, like your cell phone or XBox, relies on software to work.  When your video game is running, it is actually software at work, listening to your controller and displaying the video on your TV.  When you open Facebook, its software that is displaying the website, looking up your friends, and notifying you when you have a message!

## OK, where do I start?
1. [Open this link in your browser](https://studio.code.org/s/starwarsblocks/stage/1/puzzle/1) - Let's build a Star Wars game!
2. Let's do Lesson 1 together.  *Visualize* your problem.  What do we want BB8 to do?  Use your finger.  Try Lesson 2 on your own, then *stop*!
3. Let's do Lesson 3 together. *Break* the problem down into pieces.  How many sections do you see? Try lesson 4 on your own, then *stop*!
4. Let's do Lesson 5 together. Solve *one* piece at a time!  Don't solve the whole problem at once - it will get too difficult. Try doing lessons 6 through 10 on your own.  After 10, then *stop*. If you see a friend struggling, try helping them out!
5. Let's do Lesson 11 together. Remember, solve *one* piece at a time! This rule is the most important of them all. You can run your program as many times as you like. Do the rest of the lessons on your own!

## Great job!
Remember the 3 keys to good programming -
* *Visualize* your problem.  
* *Break* the problem down into pieces.  
* Solve *one* piece at a time!
